Yes — this is ringing the right bell. Here’s the clean refresher, without digging you back into the weeds.

### Where the **Terms & Conditions** live (the ones we created for quotes)

They are **not** in a PDF file or hard-coded in the quote template.

They live here:

**Supabase → `quote_terms` table**

That table was designed specifically so:

* T&Cs can be **versioned**
* One version is marked **active**
* The active version is **pulled automatically into every quote PDF**

### How they surface in the system

* The **content** is stored as rich HTML in `quote_terms.content`
* The **active record** (`is_active = true`) is:

  * Injected into the **Quote PDF footer**
  * Included when the quote is **emailed to the customer**
* Older versions remain for **audit / legal history**, but are not shown

### Where you edit them in the app (by design)

In the **Settings page** we mapped earlier:

**Settings → Quotes & Invoices → 📄 Terms & Conditions**

That editor is the UI layer for the `quote_terms` table:

* Edit text
* Increment version
* Activate / deactivate
* No code changes required

### Quick mental model (so it sticks)

* **PDF template** = layout only
* **`quote_terms`** = legal truth
* **Settings → T&Cs editor** = control panel
* **Active version** = what customers see on quotes

If you want, next we can:

* Re-open the actual wording we drafted and review it line-by-line, or
* Decide exactly *where* it appears in the quote (full page vs footer vs appendix) and lock that in.
