# Insulation Requirements for Landlords under the Residential Tenancies Act

By 1 July 2019, all remaining residential rental properties covered by the Residential Tenancies Act (RTA) must meet the new insulation requirements.

Landlords are required to make a statement in the tenancy agreement on the extent of and details about the insulation installed in their residential property. In order to make this statement, landlords will need to check and confirm what insulation is installed in their rental property.

If the existing insulation does not meet the minimum thermal requirements (expressed in R-values) specified in the regulations, or is incomplete, damaged, or damp, landlords will need to either replace the existing insulation or install new insulation in the ceiling and underfloor to meet the current Building Code requirements.

Rental properties must have ceiling and underfloor insulation that, at the time of installation, would have met or exceeded the 1978 Standard Permitted Combinations for Type A Construction (NZS4218P:1977).

Ceiling insulation must cover all spaces used for daily activities, excluding clearance required around downlights and flues. Areas with habitable space above are exempt from requiring insulation. Where there is existing insulation, it must be in reasonable condition, complete, undamaged, and dry.

A suspended floor must have underfloor insulation which is complete, undamaged, and dry. It must cover all habitable spaces. A concrete slab-on-ground floor, or floors with habitable space below, are exempt. Where there is existing insulation, it must be in good condition, complete, and any damaged or damp insulation must be replaced.

All insulation retrofitted or installed in rental properties after 1 July 2016 must be installed in accordance with the New Zealand Standard Energy Efficiency NZS 4246:2016 – Installing Insulation.

Existing rental properties that already have insulation installed must be upgraded if the ceiling and underfloor insulation does not meet the R-value levels set out in Table 1.

These R-values are roughly equivalent to those that applied for new buildings in the 1978 minimum thermal requirements (NZS4218P:1977). If a property was built after 1978 and complied with the minimum insulation requirements at the time it was built, the property will comply, provided the insulation is in reasonable condition.

Existing rental properties which currently have no insulation in the ceilings and underfloors must have new insulation installed in these places. The new insulation must meet minimum requirements benchmarked on the current Building Code (H1/AS1) requirements for ceilings and underfloor areas.

For properties that do not have ceiling and underfloor insulation that meets the R-value requirements in Table 1, new ceiling and underfloor insulation must be installed to ensure the total level of insulation meets or exceeds the minimum thermal requirements. The installation of electrically conductive insulation products (such as reflective foil products) is banned.

Ceiling insulation must be replaced if it is excessively compressed, damp, or damaged, or topped up where new insulation is installed over existing insulation that is still in reasonable condition.

## Exclusions

1. When it is not practical to retrofit insulation because of the physical design or construction of the property until access is gained.  
2. When a landlord intends to demolish or substantially rebuild within 12 months of the commencement of a tenancy and can provide evidence of having applied for the necessary consents.  
3. A time-limited exemption (12 months from the date of purchase) where a property is purchased and immediately rented back to the former owner-occupier.

Ceiling insulation must cover all applicable habitable spaces. A suspended sub-floor must have underfloor insulation in reasonable condition covering all applicable habitable spaces. However, if there is a property above that is insulated at or above the minimum requirements, the landlord does not need to insulate the ceiling of the property below.
